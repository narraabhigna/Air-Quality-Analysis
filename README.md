# Air Quality Analysis

Welcome to the Air Quality Analysis project! This project focuses on analyzing five years of air quality data in India (2015-2020) to identify critical factors influencing air pollution and investigate trends, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Project Overview

This project leverages statistical tools and data visualization techniques to analyze air quality data from 2015 to 2020. The analysis aims to identify correlations between pollutants, compare annual air quality indexes, and investigate trends across major cities in India during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Utilized statistical tools for correlation and exploratory data analysis to identify key factors influencing air pollution.
- **Data Visualization**: Developed visual representations, including scatter plots and Q-Q plots, to discern correlations between pollutants and compare annual air quality indexes.
- **Trend Investigation**: Investigated air quality trends during the COVID-19 pandemic across nine major cities in the dataset.
- **Reporting**: Summarized key findings and trends in clear, accessible reports to aid effective communication of complex data to diverse audiences.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Collected air quality data from various sources for the years 2015-2020.
2. **Data Analysis**: Used Pandas for data manipulation and statistical tools to identify correlations and perform exploratory data analysis.
3. **Data Visualization**: Created scatter plots, Q-Q plots, and other visualizations using Matplotlib to present the analysis results.
4. **Reporting**: Compiled findings and trends into comprehensive reports for easy understanding and communication.
